These are my R scripts to generate the charts for my regular Team Health report

Previously I generated all of this in Excel, in an effort to automate it even further I am migrating it to R

Bugs - year to date, total bugs open by iteration, bugs remaining open by iteration, bugs by user story, bug weekly trend
Dev Commits - size of commits by dev, size of commit by dev by code base comparison
Code Coverage
Commit vs Complete
